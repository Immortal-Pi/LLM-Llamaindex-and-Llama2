Players must arrive 10 minutes prior \nto their reserved  time in order to keep their reservation.  When guests are participating in the use of an amenity,  the resident must \nbe a participant in the activity at all times.  However,  if residents with no guest wish to play, the group with a guest must either \naccommodate the new players or cease the activity within  15 minutes.  The amenities  below do not all occur at all properties.  \nObviously, it is not intended  that any property is a playground for non-residents.  Therefore, we not only regulate non-resident  use \nof amenities, we can further restrict the use of amenities  by guests when resident demand prevails.

We recommend that you carry \ninsurance but do not require  it unless you are bringing your pet into the  dog park.\n8.FIRE HAZARD \u2013 Kitchen is #1; Bedroom is #2; Fireplace is  #3; BBQ\u2019s is  #4!\nIf conditions are safe, first phone the fire department  then our on-call maintenance  person.\n(a)If you do not own a fire extinguisher,  we encourage you to buy one.  We recommend a fire extinguisher  labeled  all purpose for \ncombinations of inflammables: grease; oil; gasoline; electrical.  Management  experience is that this may save considerable loss \nof property.  We will refund  to you 1/3 of your cost up to $10.  Remember, first protect  lives, then dial 911 and, if safety permits, \nattempt to put out  the fire.\n(b)Keep matches out of reach  of children and away from sources of  heat such as  kitchen ranges or heaters.\n(c)If fire occurs  from cooking, do not use water.  WATER SPREADS A GREASE FIRE!  For large grease fires or if a small \nfire is not very quickly  extinguished, call 911 immediately.  For small grease fires, first turn off the heat.  The most effective \nmeans to put out a small grease fire, in order, are: (1) using a dry chemical-type or all-purpose extinguisher; (2) using baking \nsoda, if available; and (3) by smothering the fire by covering the pot or pan with a lid.  If no lid is available, you may also \nsmother a grease  fire by thoroughly  soaking a towel  with water and covering the grease  fire.  If you throw a wet towel on the \nfire, do not tip  the pot or pan over as it  spreads the fire very quickly.\n(d)DO NOT BURN CANDLES, INCENSE, OR USE  OIL  LAMPS.\n(e)Never  smoke  when  working around flammable liquids  or oxygen tanks.  Make  sure matches  and smoking materials are \nfully extinguished before  disposing of them (pinch  the ends of objects which were  lighted before  placing  them in trash  cans).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3783, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b13979f-42a6-464c-b96a-92231fc8d3a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b13979f-42a6-464c-b96a-92231fc8d3a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "203f9f40-f74b-4423-89bc-67d7c378b8b1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "36d7e079b8cc083b87a9da8e5b0a1188828b4e88f4ade5865b415cef7b7fd222", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d128c0fc-1f23-40b6-bcbe-7e5537374104", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "ccbcdf4698b0082b12865ffdd5bdab9a6f68e26d2683bf5c4f42d946b5a50214", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If no lid is available, you may also \nsmother a grease  fire by thoroughly  soaking a towel  with water and covering the grease  fire.

Do not smoke  in bed.  You may fall asleep.  Stay awake and \nsober if smoking in a  soft chair.\n(f)Keep storage areas and closets cleared of old rags,  papers, mattresses,  broken  furniture  and other combustible materials.  Never \nstore gasoline or other flammable liquid  in your apartment, garage or patio/balcony  area.  Propane containers are not permitted \nin resident controlled areas.\n(g)After using oily polishing rags, place  them in metal covered cans.   Paint  and varnish, etc., must be kept in tightly closed \ncontainers.  Never  use gasoline, benzene or other flammable liquids for cleaning  clothes, furnishings, appliances, floors or \nanything else.  Some of these  chemicals  may cause cancer.\n(h)We recommend against using the fireplace because it is a fire hazard.  Most of  the heat  energy  goes  out the chimney.   \n(i)Cooking Device not provided by the owner - these may not be used  or stored on a patio or balcony or in a garage  or \napartment.\n(j)Do not use portable electric heaters.\n(k)For patio/balcony barbecue/charcoal  grills see rules and regulations.\n(l)When grease, fat, lard or cooking oil overheats, it will smoke just before catching  fire.  Immediately turn the heat down or off.  \nKeep your kitchen range, including the oven and broiler, free of  grease.\n(m)Fire in the oven can usually  be extinguished  by closing the oven door and turning off the heat or using  a dry, chemical-type \nextinguisher.  Call 911.\n(n)Stove burners can ignite loose fitting shirts,  blouses, pajamas and robes.\n(o)Do not leave cooking  food unattended.  Keep pot handles turned in  and away from edge of stove.\n(p)Do not keep items desired by children  on or above the stove.\n(q)Know your  various exits in case  of fire.\n(r)Do not store combustible  materials on balconies  or in hallways or stairways where fire could  prevent  escape.\n(s)In case  of fire, check  door handles for  heat  before  opening  doors.\nElectrical Hazards\n(t)Never replace a  fuse.   Call Management.  For electrical outages, have flashlights and batteries on hand.\n(u)Be sure appliance  cords are not worn or frayed with loose prongs.  Pull cords out by holding the plug, not the cord.  Avoid  \nusing extension cords with multiple plugs.  Unplug irons & similar appliances when not  in use.\n(v)Do not run electrical cords  under rugs, through doorways  or over  hooks, radiators, heaters, pipes or ducts.\n(w)If cracked sockets or hot switch plates  call management.\n9.INTRUDER ALARM\nFor units without a built-in alarm, residents are urged to purchase an alarm  security device.   Such devices  are available  at most \nelectronic stores and either plug into a wall outlet or operate with a battery.  When set, these devices  detect movement and the \nresulting loud noise will generally cause an intruder to leave the apartment.  The cost for these devices  is extremely small compared \nto what is lost when a  burglary takes place.  In addition, such an  alarm  may also protect your person as well.\n10.ELECTRIC ENERGY SAVING TIPS\nTurn off all lights when not in use.  Clean lamps,  fixtures and diffusers on a regular basis for best lighting.   If you are using  a \u201cnight  \nlight\u201d try the one watt,  LED  photocell which can be placed in an electric  outlet.  See also: Cooling and Heating System;  Clothes \nDryer and Washer.

Periodically check under  sink for hidden leaks and check your \nhot water heater for rusting or leaks, especially if there is decreased temperature or duration of hot water.  Run each sink faucet  for \n1-2 minutes  before drinking if the water has not have been turned  on for a  number of weeks.\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 456B0394-6B42-49BE-8AE3-44E639F95363", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3221, "end_char_idx": 4916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35ef180e-4c38-4935-b1a5-54fad044dfae": {"__data__": {"id_": "35ef180e-4c38-4935-b1a5-54fad044dfae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86effefb-0844-4e7a-954f-25c25b064f88", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "2e94aa797c948aa581c6a35af1613a6a506157a9936cc0a80a89a08b60918a73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6841f851-edbf-4e56-ba73-6722c46a694c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "01717e25240f55d8341debe91cf146d7cd35413763f32bd8d99ec84b22d575f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rev: 06/28/24 Page 5 of 16 Property of Management Support\n\\4800 Resident Handbook\\480312.GENERAL CLEANING GUIDELINES:\nFiberglass Tub/Shower  \u2013 After use, wipe down the tub ledge, where the tub meets the wall.  Caulking  may be cleaned and whitened \nwith Clorox Cleanup\u00ae  or similar product.\nGrout/Caulking \u2013 Request a  service  call.\nCeiling Fan Care  \u2013 Fans  tend to collect  dust during the winter when there is less use.  Place each fan blade inside a pillow  case to \nwipe each blade and  catch the  dust.  Then wash off the blades  with plain water and  dry.\nWindow Blind  Care \u2013 Vacuum regularly with a brush attachment to prevent dirt build up.  A dry microfiber cloth also may be \nused.  Do not spray a glass cleaner on blinds or shades  because it will stain the blinds.   Before raising or lowering the blinds,  always \nturn the blinds  to the open  position.\nContact Paper \u2013 Do not use contact paper to line drawers or shelves because it cannot be easily removed, resulting in increased \ncharges on move-out.\nStainless Steel Appliances \u2013 Like wood, steel has a grain.  An entire sheet of steel will have  the same direction grain but an \nindividual appliance may have different pieces of steel used for different  parts such as handles and knobs.  Wiping in the correct \ndirection will prevent cleaning residue and grime from  getting deeper into the crevices of the grain.  Apply a small  amount of dish \nsoap to a damp 100% cotton,  non-abrasive cleaning rag or paper towel (never  use an abrasive cleaner and scratcher sponge).  Wipe \nalong the grain line of your appliance.  Stubborn areas may need to be gone  over several times.  Use a dry towel to remove any \nwater marks  after thoroughly cleaning an area.  Lastly, polish the surface with a small (a couple drops) amount of baby/mineral oil \non a fresh rag  or paper towel.   Follow the grain of the  steel back  and forth when applying.\nStainless Steel Sinks \u2013 Hope\u2019s  \u201cPerfect Sink\u201d cleans, shine and protects SS  sinks.   Available at Home Depot.\n13.AUTOMATIC DISHWASHER\nResident Use\n(a)Wash  full loads only.  Before using, make  sure disposal side of sink is free of garbage, stopper  is removed and no water is \nstanding in sink.  Use only for intended purpose.  Never clean filters  in the dishwasher.\n(b)Inspect dishwasher base beneath basket for glass, garbage, paper, silverware,  etc., dropped from prior loads.  Remove  if present.\n(c)Before placing dishware and silverware in dishwasher, remove all food debris  and garbage by scraping  off all food material.  \nDishwashers are  not garbage disposals.\n(d)Load basket so glass will not strike other  dishware and  pots/pans as  breakage  may occur.\n(e)Secure all plastic and wood dishware and utensils  to eliminate movement or floatation as they may be damaged  by the heating \nelement or  cause a fire.\n(f)Use correct detergent.  The most common  source of damage  to dishwashers  is the use of the wrong detergent.  Only detergents \nspecified for a dishwasher  should  be used and in the exact quantity suggested  by the manufacturer.  Place 1-2 tablespoons of \ndishwasher crystals in the soap dispenser and close cover.  In order to prevent  caking, detergents should be added immediately \nbefore the dishwasher  cycle is to begin.  In hard water areas,  use a rinsing  agent.  Keep detergents and rinse  agents away from \nchildren.\n(g)Position drying  agent (\"Jet  Dry\" basket) so  water from  spray arm can dissolve and  disperse  it properly.\n(h)Loading - load only dishes and utensils  for dishwashers.  Generally, metal items should be placed away from  the detergent.  Do \nnot place  large objects  next to the detergent  cup or smaller objects.  Secure lightweight items so that they will not be moved by \nwater force.\n(i)Roll baskets in and close door.  Turn  timer  to \"START\" position and latch  door, interlocking arm.  Note:   If operations sequence \ndoes not begin, manually advance timer slowly until water fill is  heard.\n(j)Once cycle has begun, do not interrupt or open  door until  timer is in  \"OFF\" position.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4064, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6841f851-edbf-4e56-ba73-6722c46a694c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6841f851-edbf-4e56-ba73-6722c46a694c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86effefb-0844-4e7a-954f-25c25b064f88", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "2e94aa797c948aa581c6a35af1613a6a506157a9936cc0a80a89a08b60918a73", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35ef180e-4c38-4935-b1a5-54fad044dfae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "10bb9014ed503c069b630e623f96587c1b7ee8c3b17a17afe9bc46832a2c5313", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In hard water areas,  use a rinsing  agent.

Dishwashers may have  a plastic screen/grate at the bottom to catch food, debris,  etc.  \nClean with a wet  cloth or use the \u201cheavy clean\u201d setting.\n14.CLOTHES DRYER & WASHER\nDryer:  Resident  Care\n(a)Daily, clean the lint trap  before every dryer load and use a  vacuum to remove any  lint from the exhaust duct.\n(b)Use in the early evening rather than daytime when temperature exceeds 75\u00b0.\nWasher:  Resident Care\n(a)Wash  only full loads to save energy.\n(b)Over  sudsing causes leaks and blocks drains.  To reduce the suds, pour \u00bd cup white vinegar mixed  with cold water into the \nwasher.  Next time, use less detergent  (try a  low-suds type).\n(c)If washer will not spin or begins to vibrate,  the wash load may be too large  or out of balance.  Try removing  some items  or \nredistribute the load.\n(d)Do not allow the washer to run when you are not in the apartment.   If the washer overflows or the water hose leaks, you must \nbe around to prevent damage to  flooring  and/or carpet.\n15.COOLING & HEATING SYSTEMS\nEnergy Saving  Tips\n(a)Filters need changing when you cannot distinguish  the blue/green color.  We change filters  during apartment turnover and \nquarterly.  If you believe our policy was not followed or that your filters  should be changed, request a service call or obtain \nfilters from the  office.\n(b)Digital  Thermostat \u2013 if you need this device, contact  the office.   There\u2019s no additional  charge to you for the unit or installation.  \nDuring the day, close windows, doors,  drapes and blinds (set mini-blinds  with the leading  edge  up) to reduce heat gain.   Shaded  \nrooms are cooled more  easily and economically.  Close vents  and doors  to rooms that are not being  cooled or heated.  Set the \nfan to \u201cauto\u201d so that it only runs when the unit is operating.  Maximize the extent you can use ceiling fans rather than expensive \nair conditioning.\n(c)Temperature  settings should be set to increase  or decrease the temperature generally from daytime to nighttime.   There should  \nbe a minimum of 2-3\u00b0 difference between heating and cooling so that the functions  are not constantly alternating off and on.  \nIn setting  the air conditioning to cool,  read the thermostat as \u201ccool to\u201d or, if heating, the temperature is set \u201cheat to.\u201d  Instructions \nfor the digital, programmable  thermostat are available in your  hiring packet, as well as via email.\n(d)Never obstruct  the flow of air with furniture,  as this will cause short cycling and  poor operation.\n(e)Appliances (dishwasher, clothes washer/dryer)  give off heat that the air conditioner must  reduce.  Minimize the use of \nappliances during the warmest part  of the day.\n(f)When cooking, use the vent fan.  It will send heated  air directly outside.  When  pre-heating the oven,  10 minutes is usually \nsufficient.  When  cooking on the stove top, match the diameter of pots and pans to those of the heating elements to prevent \nheat from escaping and  less heat  escapes  if pots and pans are covered.\n(g)Keep furnishings at least  three feet  away  from  a wall heater.\nHeating:\n(a)When going to bed, set thermostat \u201cheat to\u201d 63\u00b0 - 64\u00b0 F and use layered blankets/comforters.   When leaving  the apartment,  be \nsure the heating  is \u201con\u201d if temperature is at  or approaching freezing.\n(b)Management  can assist with  cleaning/replacing  filters, checking flue pipes, connectors and gas vents.\nCooling:\n(a)Set the air control  to \u201cCLOSED\u201d or \u201cRECIRCULATE\u201d.\n(b)Never operate an air conditioner  without a filter in place.  The humidity increases when the A/C is on.  Generally,  A/C \u201cset to\u201d \n76\u00b0 - 78\u00b0  is sufficient and saves electricity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3992, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58abbc64-fe67-4a24-8b64-5feddc089d9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "58abbc64-fe67-4a24-8b64-5feddc089d9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f0e89502-c9c5-4e86-9b33-c2f02cbefd85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "7ea3de9d7ca0793726ef809237c1f4937cb0bf837ec6782c352345c04ae290cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9aa0af94-7ee0-4ce2-be19-c0cae798e139", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "76accb9a346576e82ea1d5d377e14646f508116dbf9e2a32617d59f142407acd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(g)Keep furnishings at least  three feet  away  from  a wall heater.\nHeating:\n(a)When going to bed, set thermostat \u201cheat to\u201d 63\u00b0 - 64\u00b0 F and use layered blankets/comforters.

Otherwise, the coffee grounds  pile up in the pipe and, overtime, pack  the \npipe completely.\n(e)Completely grind  vegetable peelings in small  amounts with other food wastes;  place fibrous vegetable materials in a plastic \nlined trash  receptacle.\n(f)Never overload disposal; jamming results when wastes are compacted.\n(g)Never dispose of grease,  oils or cooking fat in drains or garbage disposal.\nPlease do not pour grease down garbage disposal/drains.  Grease  floats on water  and sticks to pipes.  It is not dissolved by \nhot water.\n(a)Keep an old milk carton or  frozen juice container under your sink.  Pour cooled oil  (salad/frying/bacon) into the container and \nthrow it out with your trash.\n(b)Use a paper  towel to wipe  off dishes and pots coated  with grease before washing or placing these items in  the dishwater.\n(c)Scrape fat dripping  from  meat into a  plastic bag or container and toss it in the trash.\n(d)Please tell your children about the  importance of these measures.\nResident Care If Disposal Becomes Inoperative \u2013 Request a Service Call\n(a)Turn wall switch off  and switch electrical breaker \"Off\" (or unplug under sink).\n(b)Visually check for foreign obstacles, bones, silverware, pits, pop tops, etc. and remove  any debris.\n(c)If jammed and no key is available, use broom or  mop handle to  move the rotor blade.  Remove debris.\n(d)Plug unit in.  Push  \"RESET\" on bottom  of disposal.\n(e)Turn cold water on (heavy stream).\n(f)Flip wall switch to \"ON\" position  and flush thoroughly for  fifteen seconds.\n(g)If unit will not operate,  check \"RESET\"  button  on bottom of disposal  and electrical breaker  for \"ON\" position.   Call \nmanagement.\n(h)Never use  chemical drain  openers in disposal.  Permanent damage may occur.\n(i)Weekly, flush  the garbage disposal by filling the sink with three inches of water, then draining  while the disposal  is in operation.\n(j)You are responsible for maintenance and repairs of the garbage disposal if the problem results from your abuse. For example,  \nwhen refried beans are put into the garbage disposal, this causes \"sticking\" and malfunction.\n(k)Resident Care of Sink/Drains - to prevent clogging sink pipes, pore \u00bd cup baking  soda into drain,  then pour \u00bd cup vinegar \nover it.

After opening,  close the door as  quickly as  possible.\n(f)Wipe all  moisture  from  bottles and cartons before placing  them in the  refrigerator.\n20.TOILET\nLO-FLOW \u2013 Too much  thick dual ply tissue causes blockage  and overflow.  Of course, other major causes of blockage are cotton \nswabs and inappropriate  paper/objects dumped into the toilet.  Never flush wipes  or feminine products  down the toilet, even  if they \nclaim to  be \u201cflushable\u201d.   Avoid pass-through service call costs to clean inappropriate blockages and  keep  a plunger handy.\nOverflow Control \u2013 Our \u201cgift\u201d toilet plunger  can come in handy.  If a toilet is about to overflow, quickly lift off the cover on \nthe water tank.   This water is clean.  Above the water outlet pipe is a rubber gasket which generally floats down to cover the opening.  \nPush the gasket down to cover the opening.   Usually, you can hold the gasket over the opening  while  you turn-off the water inflow \nvalve in a clockwise  direction on the wall behind the toilet.  This process should  prevent water damage to the floor and carpet.  With \nthe water overflow problem stabilized,  use the plunger.   For best results, tip the plunger into the toilet water to allow water to fill \nthe cup before plunging.  Plunging with water  in the plunger  cup works much  better  clearing the clog.  Rapidly pump the plunger a \ndozen times or more to force release  of the obstruction.  If the maintenance request  is due to resident negligence, there  is a service \nfee charge.  Do not leave the dwelling with a toilet running or filling.\n21.HOT  WATER AND HOT  WATER HEATER\nWater faucet and shower head temperature  should be 120\u00ba F or less to avoid  scalding.   Anytime you are concerned  about the \ntemperature of your hot water, call maintenance  immediately and do not turn on hot water.  Water  temperature above 125\u00ba F can \ncause severe burns instantly or death from scalding.  At 140 \u00ba F, hot water can produce 3rd degree burns  in less than 5 seconds and \nin 30 seconds at 130\u00ba F.

Carefully read \nand follow  cautionary information on their labels.  \n(h)AVOIDING  WATER  DAMAGE TO \u201cFAUX  WOOD\u201d FLOORS\nDo not run your washing  machine unattended.   Do not set potted plants directly on the floor.  Do not  wax the floor surface.\n27.CARPET CARE & MAINTENANCE \nStain Removal \u2013 Treatment  of the affected area should begin immediately upon discovery. The more time that elapses before \ntreatment, the more difficult a stain will be to remove.\n(a)First, scrape food spill gently with a spoon or dull  knife, removing as  much  solid material as  possible.\n(b)Try to remove  stains with warm water only. If a stain  cannot be removed with a warm  wet cloth, or warm water extraction, \napply low-residue  carpet  spot remover  (with the  Carpet and Rug  Institute Seal of Approval) to  the stain.\n(c)Working from outer  edge  toward the center to avoid  spreading, blot with a clean cloth or paper towel. Do not rub or scrub. \nContinue to spray  and blot until the stain is gone. Do not over-saturate carpet.   Use small amounts of solution and blot \nfrequently.\n(d)Important: Maximum pH of cleaning chemical should be pH 10 or less.  Before using,  always test cleaners on a small,  non-\nvisible area for  any discoloration of the pile.\n(e)Abnormally large or excessive stains may require hot water  extraction  method (140 degrees maximum temperature). \nProfessional cleaning  is recommended.\n(f)If a stain returns--a condition known as ''wicking''--simply  repeat stain removal procedures, paying  special  attention to blotting \nand removal of all moisture.\nRegular Vacuuming \u2013 Most  dirt, and even dust, takes the form of hard particles. When left in the carpet,  these gritty, sharp particles \nabrade the pile of the carpet.  Regular vacuuming  not only prolongs the life of the carpet but will enhance its appearance as well. \nMost soiling in carpet  is of the dry particle type which  can be removed with a vacuum cleaner.  Vacuum high-traffic areas daily, \nmedium-to-high traffic areas  twice weekly, and the entire  house at least  once a week.\n28.SATELLITE DISH &  TELEVISION,  REGULATIONS &  INSTALLATION\nFlat screen TV brackets  should be screwed into a stud.  There is a small charge to patch the holes left and paint when  the apartment \nis vacated.\nFor extension beyond the confines of the unit, including  patio or  balcony, see  below.  You  cannot:\n(a)Cause a window,  wall, balcony,  floor, balcony railing  or door to be drilled or otherwise penetrated  by a satellite dish or antennae \nmounting device.\n(b)Attach a satellite dish to a pole that extends  beyond  the individual resident\u2019s  roofline.\n(c)Attach the  dish to any  device that causes the dish to extend  at any angle beyond  the balcony railing .

Trash must  be in a plastic bag with a tie top.  Improper bags which leak or are placed on non-\ndesignated pick-up days will be returned to you and you will be billed  penalty fees.  Obviously,  placing trash for pick-up  on non-\ndesignated days is unsightly and attracts pests.\n30.MOLD/MILDEW AVOIDANCE POLICY AND REMEDIATION (See your Lease Agreement.)\nWe are committed to promptly making repairs to remove sources  of water or moisture and to accommodate  your moving out of the \napartment according to our lease  provisions.   Of course, no one can prevent  you from vacating your apartment.\nMold grows where there is moisture, dampness, or humidity.   You must promptly  notify us if (a) you find any areas  in your \napartment unit which are damp,  or (b) if you detect a musty smell in your apartment unit.  On your part, you should take action to \nprevent moisture  or dampness by inspecting your apartment unit regularly and  reporting to  us, as  follows:\n(a)Cabinets below sinks  \u2013 Look for leaks in the kitchen and bathrooms, and wherever a  sink  is present.\n(b)Shower  area \u2013 Look for signs of moisture on the top ledge of the wall tile and note if the fixture  covering  the shower pipe as it \nexits the wall is loose or lacks caulking.\n(c)Look for stains  in the ceiling or  walls or around window casings.\n(d)Check appliances, such as  the washing  machine hose and  hot water heater, for signs  of water leakage.\n(e)Remove any visible moisture accumulating  on windows,  walls, ceilings, floors  and other surfaces as  soon as possible.\n(f)Turn the kitchen exhaust fan on before you start cooking  to prevent  the build-up  of steam.\n(g)When showering, be  sure  to keep the  shower curtain  inside the bathtub  or fully close the shower doors.\n(h)Be sure the bathroom exhaust fan is on when hot water is used or the mirror shows  fogging.  Keep the fan on until all moisture \non the mirrors and/or  bathroom walls and tile surfaces has evaporated.  Avoid hot showers/baths during the warmest hours of \nthe day.  Long  hot showers/baths significantly increases  both electric  and water cost.  Keep the bathroom  door closed when in \nuse with the exhaust  fan on to remove and prevent warm moisture from  circulating throughout  the apartment.  Bathroom \nhumidity may cause damages to venting and walls, including mildew.\n(i)The presence of  indoor plants  requiring watering may increase moisture which promotes mold/mildew.\n(j)Propping furniture, boxes or other objects closely against  wall  surfaces leads to mold/mildew.\n(k)Constant, low temperature air-conditioning not only wastes energy but increases the accumulation of condensation along A/C \nlines promoting mold/mildew.\n31.PESTS\n(a)Roaches:   The following pertains to items which attract ants as well as roaches.

All insects  are driven by chemicals in their \nsearch for food and water.  Roaches and ants have a keen sense  of smell.  Roaches will be attracted to and eat anything that has \nnutritional value (omnivores).  They are especially attracted to starch,  sugar, grease,  meat,  cheese, decaying food items.   They \nwill find tiny particles left on plates, pots, pans, scraps  falling  from the table, and remnants left on counter top or in pet dishes.  \nRoaches need moisture  to survive and this search may bring  them into even the \u201ccleanest  of homes.\u201d  Leaky pipes and faucets \nare reasons roaches may travel to bathrooms, kitchens and laundry rooms.  This is one of the reasons why we ask residents to \nimmediately request maintenance if you observe a water leak problem.  Additional information is available on numerous  \nwebsites.  You will be charged for a vendor visit if we treat for roaches during  your occupancy and our photos demonstrate \nthat you permitted items which attract roaches by insufficient cleaning.  \n(i) Do not keep brown-paper grocery sacks  around  since they may  be contaminated  with  roach eggs.  Roaches  can thrive \nin the  dark folds of paper sacks.\n(ii) Do not leave food uncovered.\n(iii) Promptly  clean food, crumbs and  liquid spills.  Sweep and mop  the kitchen floor  regularly.\n(iv) Vacuum carpets frequently  to remove crumbs and other food particles dropped  by people and  pets.\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 456B0394-6B42-49BE-8AE3-44E639F95363", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3467, "end_char_idx": 5480, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c8d6c63-951e-4f25-a150-3cb4481a3af6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c8d6c63-951e-4f25-a150-3cb4481a3af6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "503bc591-1050-47a6-acb0-58f97c5f40e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "2b65d354269bae8dd1bca922a3c57d9bf9d13d6ebdedd58d5a9b036bb0aa8ca1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "355f7bf4-31df-4f30-b922-177ac986322b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e08a7e7d3788839a9bac837d75ac634d9c0d2b6463041902b40ad09268932bb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rev: 06/28/24 Page 14 of 16 Property of Management Support\n\\4800 Resident Handbook\\4803(v) All trash must be  placed in plastic bags with tightly  sealed ties before  being  placed  in the dumpster.

Immediately advise the office if you see \none.  We will promptly inspect and perform mitigation.  Scorpions cannot jump.  Scorpions do not nest.  Pesticides do not \neliminate scorpions.  Phoenix Children's Hospital  sees many more patients each month during the summer  months than during \nthe winter.  In case of scorpion sting, immediately cover the area with ice and seek medical attention.   Without  anti-venom, \nsymptoms can last up to 24 hours.  Infants and young children are at greater  risk.  A national hotline  has been provided for \ninformation, prevention and treatment  of poison at (800) 222-1222, or visit www.poisoncontrol.com (Texas)  or visit \nwww.bannerhealth.com (Arizona) and search for poison  for more information.  Additional measures you can take to avoid \ncontact with scorpions are: a) Put crib and other bed legs in a clean, wide-mouth jar.  Scorpions cannot climb  on clean glass; \nb) Wrap bed legs with duct tape (sticky-side up); c) Pull beds away from walls; d) Shake  clothing before putting on; e) Place \nbaking soda, talcum  or body powder under  kitchen  sinks and in closets along  the edges.\n(d)Mosquitoes:  Mosquitoes breed in areas  of standing  water and have a range in flight of a number of miles.  If you have  planter \nsaucers or pet water bowls, be sure these are emptied daily.  If you find any such areas on the premises, immediately  report this \nto our office.   Generally, mosquitoes are most active  from dusk until dawn;  however, another type of mosquito with dark bands  \naround its legs is active during the day.  Different varieties of mosquitoes  carry different diseases which spread to humans  if a \nmosquito is carrying  the infectious agent, generally a virus.  Minimize exposed  areas  of the skin and apply mosquito repellent \ncontaining DEET or equivalent repellent.  Call maintenance if you observe standing water on the premises. Remember, if you \nhave potential breeding areas  on your patio or balcony such as small plants in pots with saucers which  have standing water, \nyou may be breeding mosquitos.\n(e)Bedbugs:  Bedbugs are blood-feeding, brownish-red insects, about  \u00bc inch long and flat.  Once they've had a blood  meal, they \nswell and turn a dark reddish-brown.  These insects live in cracks  and voids  near areas frequented by people, usually in \nbedrooms or other sites where people might  sit or rest. Their flattened shape allows them to easily slip into narrow places  in \nmattress seams, bed frames, headboards, bedside furniture, behind pictures and switch plates,  behind  baseboards,  under buttons \non mattresses and in box springs.  If you believe you are being bitten by bedbugs,  examine these places  closely, using a \nflashlight to help look for the adult bugs as well as their tiny, whitish eggs.   The nymph  form may give off a musty, sweet odor.   \nYou should also inspect all luggage and clothes for bedbugs when returning from a trip.

If you believe you are being bitten by bedbugs,  examine these places  closely, using a \nflashlight to help look for the adult bugs as well as their tiny, whitish eggs.   The nymph  form may give off a musty, sweet odor.   \nYou should also inspect all luggage and clothes for bedbugs when returning from a trip.  Also look for bedbugs on second-\nhand items before bringing them home.  Don\u2019t buy second hand furniture  without  a very close inspection.  Their bite is nearly \npainless and usually goes unnoticed  by most people.  If you develop red, itchy, small  bumps  with a whitish center,  generally in \ngroupings of 3-4, or you notice speckles of dried  blood on your sheets, you may have bedbugs  and should  notify us immediately.  \nThe problem must  be professionally treated and if untreated,  may spread quickly.   In cases of heavy infestation additional \nmeasures such as encasing mattresses, box springs and pillows  in cover slips to seal in the remaining bed bugs or discarding \nmattresses, couches, chairs and other bulky fabric furniture may be called for.  Clothing can generally be washed and dried in \na hot dryer and hard surfaces can be cleaned.   Your vigilance is necessary in avoiding this possibility.   Dogs  are the most \naccurate detectors  of bedbugs.  See internet for additional  information.\nA vendor charge  is passed on to you under the following  circumstances.  Our policy is to have  a State  Licensed vendor \nappropriately inspect and treat each unit prior to new occupancy.  Bedbugs are brought into the premises by the resident on articles \nof furniture, bedding,  clothing, luggage,  etc.  Therefore,  there will be a vendor  charge for extermination  if bed bugs are found  after \nyour tenancy begins.\n32.PEST  CONTROL\nIf you prefer to take care of this problem yourself and/or to reject pest control  treatment:  1) Purchase a roach bait at a food \nmarket.  The apartment, cupboards, closets, should be thoroughly cleaned; 2) When  you receive notice of regular pest control \ntreatment, advise the office  and vendor in advance that  you are refusing treatment.\nTo prepare for a Professional Exterminator, contact the office for your appointment, day and approximate time.  Follow these  \ninstructions.  Remove and clean all kitchen items located  in cupboards, cabinets, shelves  and drawers.  Place all items on counter \ntops or tables and cover  these items.  Clean drawers, cabinets, pantry, and shelves using a damp cloth and cleanser and wipe  \ndry.\n(a)Floors \u2013 Must be free of debris and  cleaned.   This includes rooms and closets.\n(b)Bathrooms \u2013 Remove  contents of medicine chest and cabinets, place items in  the bathtub  and cover these items.\n(c)Bedrooms \u2013 Remove just enough garments from closets to permit easy movement within.  Remove  drawers from  dressers so \ninside of  dresser casings  can be sprayed.   Place the contents on your bed  or tables.\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 456B0394-6B42-49BE-8AE3-44E639F95363", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3225, "end_char_idx": 6434, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6ae5cdc-1f1f-4691-880a-3e94d8b254ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6ae5cdc-1f1f-4691-880a-3e94d8b254ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4abb3e06-61c5-4aa1-beea-1fbb7606cf28", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "1f3008986348b1245abd2a8fbb36245ed07e835258af188c61b79b05895cfb18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4433fc01-4109-4923-a1fe-1339b894db48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b3b1640eacfb6f5c9f222d5b4dc4351a2489f81c87d1eb090a533e19b59beb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rev: 06/28/24 Page 15 of 16 Property of Management Support\n\\4800 Resident Handbook\\4803(d)Pets and Plants \u2013 Remove  all pets and pet food bowls until 45 minutes after the pest control treatment is completed (to give the \nchemicals time to dry and  the fumes to dissipate).\n(e)If you will be out of the apartment for sufficient  time, use a fogger (but not for ants).   For all insecticides, carefully follow  \nmanufacturer's directions.  If pests  are observed after spraying, wait 2 weeks  since some insects are not killed immediately.  \nSometimes, the treatment must be repeated. When you are cleaning out drawers and cabinets, if you observe open  cracks  \nleading into the walls or floor, call management for caulking.  Aerosols kill insects on exposure but do no good for the rest of \nthe colony or reproducing  members.\n33.USE OF THEATERS\nA theater, when present, is open for group DVD movies,  children\u2019s  movies on Saturday morning, home  team  sporting  events and \nevents of high-general interest.  An individual Resident request is considered if there is anticipated, general interest.  You may rent \na theater for a private event or showing, subject to availability.  An hourly  rental fee and deposit will be required for such use.  We \ndo not permit  smoking  or boisterous activity in the theater at any time.   Food and drinks are permitted only for private events where \na deposit has been paid.   Big screen TVs in the  clubhouse are available for individual Resident use.\n34.BBQ GRILLS\nUse these  grills at your own risk.  Prior to use of the grill, wipe  the grills down  on all sides (be sure grills surfaces are not hot) with \na wet paper towel before cooking to remove any stray strands of bristles from  a cleaning brush that might  be on the grill.  Make \nsure grill tops are fully  open (and locked, where available) or braced in their open position  (where braces  are available), to avoid \naccidental closing.\n35.VEHICLES LEAKING FLUIDS IN  THE  PARKING AREAS\nPlease maintain  your vehicle so that it does not leak.   The reason why there  is a penalty fee charged to you for cleaning up your \nparking area is because we  cannot permit  an unsightly appearance,  and vehicle fluids  damage asphalt and concrete.\n36.BIFOLD DOORS USUALLY ENCLOSING A WASHER/DRYER OR SMALL CLOSET\nContact onsite management immediately  if each of the four bifold doors  which meet in the center do not have a knob.  To open  the \ndoors, pull on the door which  has the knob in its center.   To close the doors, pull on the knob which  is on the leading edge  of the \ndoors which close in the center  of the  opening. \n37.BATTERY OPERATED DOOR LOCKS\nAt Estates of Richardson, Sky at Chandler Airpark and The Crossing at Cooley  Station, the locking system on your door is battery \noperated.  The locking system will alert you when the battery in the lock is getting weak (by either a blinking red light or audibly).  \nImmediately report this to the office since battery failure will result  in you being locked  out.  A service request will be \ngenerated to replace the batteries.  If you do not notify  us of a weak battery and you are locked out of your apartment,  you will incur \na service  fee of $50 if we are called out to unlock  your door for  you after hours.\n38.ELEVATOR BUILDINGS\nMove-Ins \u2013 VERY IMPORTANT \u2013 Elevator use must be reserved.  If you wish an elevator to be reserved during your move, we \ncan provide  an elevator key for a deposit  of $100 by personal check or money order.  Moving in or out is not permitted  between the \nhours of 5 p.m. and 8 a.m.  Please tell your moving  company if you are moving into or out of a building with underground access \nto an elevator or a  parking structure.\nChateau De Ville - You will either need a small moving  truck to enter  the garage or your moving truck must park outside of \nthe garage.  There is only a 7 ft garage entry clearance.  Use a dolly to move items into elevators.

BUYING\nHome buyers should consider all of the additional costs of ownership and future sale.  At the start,  there  are escrow  closing costs, \nfees, and loan points.  The interest rate may involve  a \u201cmortgage insurance fee,\u201d essentially, an addition to your interest  rate.  The \nmortgage lender has fire and liability insurance requirements.  While you may want the protection  of renter\u2019s  insurance, we do not \nrequire it.\nHome ownership requires a payment of property taxes and, in addition, condominium ownership involves monthly Association \ndues.  Maintenance  and  replacement costs are frequently underestimated or unbudgeted by the homeowner:  roof; appliances \n(heating, air conditioning systems; hot water heater; dishwasher; refrigerator; oven; clothes washer and dryer; garbage disposal);  \ncarpet/flooring; and plumbing & electrical problems; landscape maintenance; termite control.  Will you be a jack-of-all-trades or \nhire reliable contractors?  Compare these costs with the known cost of leasing.  At the time of house  sale, you immediately  lose \ncommission costs from  the house  value and  may  take a significant loss on the  sale.\nPersonal obligations and employment  opportunities may pressure a house  sale under adverse  market conditions.  Renting gives \nmobility to take advantage  of new,  employment opportunities.  The value of your home mortgage  income tax deduction is \nsubstantially diminished, and may be exceeded, by non-deductible ownership expenses as cited  above.   As a renter,  an income tax \ncredit may be available.\nHouse/Condominium Renting  \u2013 Apartment  renting offers significant advantages over renting  a house or condominium.  House  \nrental may require that the resident is responsible  for landscape,  pool upkeep  and appliance repair.   Not infrequently, a house  renter \ncannot rely on the owner or management company to promptly  meet obligations to repair the roof, fix leaks or perform other, needed \nrepairs.  With condominium renting, there are generally  inconsistent rental  criteria  and policies by individual condominium owners \nwhich may result in failure to remedy reasonable complaints.

To the \nextent there are any inconsistencies  between  this Addendum  and the \nApartment Lease, the  terms  of this Addendum shall control.\nAllocation.  You and we agree to the water allocation system \ndescribed below,  regarding water and wastewater.  During  the lease term \nand any extensions  thereof, we are authorized to allocate a portion  of the \nmonthly water/wastewater bill(s) for the apartment community.   The \nallocation will be based on the number of occupants in your unit.  This \nallocation method is described in the Texas Administrative Code, Title  \n16 (16 TAC), Chapter 24, Subchapter I.  More  specifically, the allocation \nwill be completed as  follows:\n1. Your monthly rent under  the lease does not include a charge for \nwater and wastewater.  Instead,  you will receive  a separate bill from \nthe vendor doing the billing for such  utilities.\n2. Your monthly water/wastewater bill will be calculated  based  on an \nallocation method that is approved  by the Public  Utility \nCommission of Texas (PUCT), as follows: Your monthly \nwater/wastewater bill will be calculated based on your per person  \nshare of the previous month\u2019s actual water/wastewater bill for the \nProperty.  Before calculating  your portion of the bill, we will deduct \nfor irrigation of landscaping and all other common area uses, as \nrequired by PUCT Rules.  We will also deduct and separately  bill \nyou for any utility company per-unit base charges and customer  \nservice charges  so that you won\u2019t  be paying  any part of such charges  \nfor vacant units.  However, you will be responsible for your \nproportionate share  (on a per unit basis) of any governmental fees \ncharged on  our water/wastewater bill.\n\u201cPer person  share\u201d means the number of occupants in your \napartment unit divided by the number of occupants in all apartment \nunits in the Property.\n3. No administration or other  fee will be added to the total \nwater/wastewater bill(s).  Penalties or interest  for any late payment \nof the mastermeter  water/wastewater bill by us will be paid for \nentirely by us  and will not be allocated.\n4. This method of determining  your allocated share of the \nwater/wastewater bill will not change  during your lease term \nwithout your prior written  consent.   We do have the right to change \nthe allocation formula,  to the extent  permitted  by the PUCT, only \nwhen (a) a lease is signed by a new resident;  or (b) a renewal lease \nis signed by you upon  not less than thirty five (35) days prior notice.5. Payment  of the allocated water/wastewater bill is due and should  be \npaid with your next rental payment, unless the water bill is \npostmarked less than sixteen  (16) days before your next rental \npayment is due, in which  case, your bill should be paid with the \nfollowing month\u2019s  rental payment.  (If your bill is hand delivered to \nyou, the date of delivery will be substituted for the postmarked \ndate.)  You will be charged a five percent (5%) late charge if your \npayment is not paid on or before your rental due date.   A summary \nof PUCT  rules regarding water/wastewater allocation is attached to \nthis Addendum.\n6. You may examine  our water/wastewater bills and our calculations \nrelating to the monthly allocation of the water/wastewater  bills \nduring regular  weekday office hours.  While  it is not required,  it will \nlessen delay if you give us reasonable advance notice to gather the \ndata.

Allocation of Stormwater/Drainage  Costs  is \nattached to and made a part of that certain  Apartment Lease  Contract  \n(\u201cApartment Lease\u201d and together with this Addendum, the \u201cLease\u201d), \nwhich you (the Resident) have entered into with us (the Owner).  To the \nextent there are any inconsistencies  between  this Addendum  and the \nApartment Lease, the  terms  of this Addendum shall control.\n1. Governmental  entities  impose stormwater/drainage fees to help pay \nfor the cost of maintaining  the infrastructure needed to prevent \nflooding and lessen the impact  of pollution on our water  system.  \nThese fees can be significant.  Our property  has chosen to allocate  \nthese fees so residents  are more aware of the true costs associated \nwith these fees.  Your monthly rent does not include  a charge for \nstormwater/drainage costs.  Instead, your utility bill will also \ninclude as a separate  and distinct charge the stormwater/drainage  \ncosts allocated to you on a  per dwelling  unit basis.\n2. A monthly administration  fee of $3.00 per month will be added to \nthe total stormwater/drainage  cost bill(s).  Penalties or interest  for \nany late payment  of the stormwater/drainage  bill by us will be paid \nfor entirely  by us  and will not be allocated.3. This method of determining  your allocated share of the \nstormwater/drainage costs will not change during your lease term \nwithout your prior written  consent.   We do have the right to change \nthe allocation formula,  to the extent  permitted  by the PUCT, only \nwhen (a) a lease is signed by a new resident;  or (b) a renewal lease \nis signed by you upon  not less than thirty five (35) days prior notice.\n4. Payment  of the allocated stormwater/drainage costs is due and \nshould be paid with your next rental payment, unless the \nstormwater/drainage cost bill is postmarked less than sixteen  (16) \ndays before  your next rental payment is due, in which  case,  your \nbill should be paid with the following month\u2019s rental payment.  (If \nyour bill is hand  delivered to you, the date of delivery will be \nsubstituted for the postmarked date.)   You will be charged a five \npercent (5%) late charge if your payment is not paid on or before \nyour rental due date.\n5. You may examine our stormwater/drainage cost bills and our \ncalculations relating to the monthly allocation  of the \nstormwater/drainage costs during regular weekday  office hours.  \nWhile it is not required,  it will lessen delay  if you give us reasonable \nadvance notice to gather the data.  Any dispute relating to the \ncomputation of your bill will be between  us and no one else.\nResident\u2019s Signatures Resident\u2019s Signatures Owner\u2019s  Representative Signature\n1.$H - S$ 4.$ADULTCHH - S3$ $e-Doc Signer  - S$\n2.$ADULTCHH - S1$ 5.$ADULTCHH - S4$\n3.$ADULTCHH - S2$ 6.$ADULTCHH - S5$\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 456B0394-6B42-49BE-8AE3-44E639F95363", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3104, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74291ee8-1f76-467c-b069-34cb7aa086b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "74291ee8-1f76-467c-b069-34cb7aa086b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f8b0d76-6990-4ff7-a6f9-0da0e7edc8e9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "LeaseAg.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\pythonProjects\\LammaIndex\\krishNaik\\data\\LeaseAg.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4381771, "creation_date": "2024-11-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-18"}, "hash": "f88d9bc14386d625f05caf64bb93475bd0556c8ff227c4dea625eab654fdd5ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Rev: 07/30/20 UNAUTHORIZED  REPRODUCTION WITHOUT WRITTEN PERMISSION  IS $1000 PER  PAGE\n\\5900 TX Tenant\\5907A CHECKLIST OF  WATER  CONSERVATION IDEAS FOR YOUR DWELLING\nIn the bathroom...\n\uf0b7Never use  the toilet to dispose of cleansing tissues,  dental  floss, cigarette butts or other  trash.\n\uf0b7When brushing your teeth, turn off the  water  until you need to rinse your  mouth.\n\uf0b7When shaving, fill the  sink  with hot water instead of letting the faucet run.\n\uf0b7Take a shorter shower.   Showers may use up to 50% of interior water consumption.\n\uf0b7Take a shower instead  of filling the tub and taking a bath.\n\uf0b7If you take  a tub bath, reduce the water level by one or two inches.\n\uf0b7Shampoo your hair in the shower.\n\uf0b7Test toilets for  leaks.   Add a few drops of food coloring to the water in  the tank, but  do not  flush.  Watch to  see if the coloring \nappears in the bowl within a  few minutes.  A slow drip can waste  as much  as 170 gallons a  day or 5,000 gallons  per month.\nIn the kitchen...\n\uf0b7Run your dishwasher  only when you have a full  load.\n\uf0b7If you wash dishes by hand, don\u2019t leave  the water running for rinsing.   Try  filling the sink  instead.\n\uf0b7Use your  sink disposal sparingly, and never for just a few  scraps.\n\uf0b7Keep a container of drinking water in the  refrigerator.\n\uf0b7When cleaning vegetables,  use a pan of cold water rather than letting the faucet  run.\n\uf0b7For cooking  most food, use only a little water in the pot and put  a lid on it.\nWhen doing  the laundry...\n\uf0b7Only wash  full loads  of laundry or adjust  the water level  to match the size of the load (if this is an option).\n\uf0b7Use cold  water as often as possible to save energy and to conserve the hot water for  uses which cold water cannot serve.\nDocuSign Envelope ID: 456B0394-6B42-49BE-8AE3-44E639F95363", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1780,
